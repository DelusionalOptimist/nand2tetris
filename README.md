This repository contains the projects that I made while reading the book `The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles`
(also known as "Nand2Tetris") by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan.

Visit the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) website to get the tools you'll need to run the code.
Also, see this [TED Talk](https://youtu.be/iE7YRHxwoDs) regarding the course by the author.
